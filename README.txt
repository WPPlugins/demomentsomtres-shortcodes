This plugin provides shortcodes that manage multi column layouts.

== Description ==

This plugin provides shortcodes that manage multi column layouts.
Provides the following shortcodes [one_half], [one_third], [two_thirds], [one_fourth], [three_fourths], [one_fifth], [two_fifth], [three_fifth], [four_fifth], [one_sixth], [five_sixth] and also the same with last (for instace [one_half_last]) that allows to determine the last column.

Development based on the development done by SimpleThemes in the WordPress Skeleton Theme (http://themes.simplethemes.com/skeleton/).

I liked very much that functionality but the theme is not the one I prefer. So I decided to extract that functionality.

= Shortcodes =

*[one_half]
*[one_third]
*[two_thirds]
*[one_fourth]
*[three_fourths]
*[one_fifth]
*[two_fifth]
*[three_fifth]
*[four_fifth]
*[one_sixth]
*[five_sixth]
*[one_half_last]
*[one_third_last]
*[two_thirds_last]
*[one_fourth_last]
*[three_fourths_last]
*[one_fifth_last]
*[two_fifth_last]
*[three_fifth_last]
*[four_fifth_last]
*[one_sixth_last]
*[five_sixth_last]

You can use the short codes in order to break text into columns. The last column must be created using the last shortcode. For instance, if you want to have a 2 identical width colums you have to use [one_half] shortcodes. So [one_half]First column[/one_half][one_half_last]Second column[/one_half_last] will do that job.
